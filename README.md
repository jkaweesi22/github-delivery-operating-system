# GitHub Delivery Operating System

> A GitHub-native Delivery Governance Framework for structured sprint execution, QA review, and collaborative production release control.

---

## Why This Exists

Engineering teams often rely on informal coordination inside GitHub — manual approvals, inconsistent sprint tracking, reactive QA engagement, and socially enforced production releases.

As teams scale, this creates:

* Delivery ambiguity
* QA bottlenecks
* Unclear accountability
* Release risk
* Cross-team misalignment

The **GitHub Delivery Operating System (Delivery OS)** embeds structured intake, sprint orchestration, QA governance, and collaborative release gates directly into engineering repositories — without replacing CI/CD pipelines or disrupting developer workflows.

## Installation

**One command** (recommended):

```bash
npx github-delivery-os install --with-templates .
```

From your repo root. Add `--with-labels` to create labels via `gh` CLI (requires `gh auth`). Use `--dry-run` to preview first.

**Alternative — clone and run script:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkaweesi22/github-delivery-operating-system
cd github-delivery-operating-system

# New install or repo with existing workflows — adds only missing files (safe)
./scripts/install.sh --with-templates /path/to/your-repo

# Also create labels via gh CLI (requires gh auth)
./scripts/install.sh --with-templates --with-labels /path/to/your-repo

# Update Delivery OS (replace existing) — use --dry-run first to preview
./scripts/install.sh --with-templates --overwrite /path/to/your-repo
```

**Note:** By default, existing files are **never overwritten**. Use `--overwrite` only when updating Delivery OS. See [Consumer Setup](docs/consumer-setup.md) for the full command guide.

**What gets installed:**

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `sprint-child-creator` | Creates child issues when a sprint (title `SPRINT -`) is opened |
| `auto-close-sprint` | Burn-down, sprint health, auto-close at 100% |
| `notify-release-approver` | Pings approver when production release issue opens |
| `authorize-deployment` | Dual approval (release approver + QA) |
| `auto-assign-qa` | Assigns QA team to `qa` / `qa-request` issues |
| `telegram-issues` | Telegram alerts for bugs, QA, sprints, releases |
| `setup-labels` | One-time workflow to create required labels |

Workflows and templates are **copied directly** into your repo. No `workflow_call` or external references.

---

## Quick Start (After Install)

1. **Create labels:** Actions → Setup Labels → Run workflow
2. **Configure variables:** Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables
   - `RELEASE_APPROVER` — GitHub username
   - `QA_APPROVER` — GitHub username
   - `QA_ASSIGNEES` — Comma-separated usernames (e.g. `user1,user2`)
3. **Optional:** Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` for alerts

---

## Sprint Child Creation

When you open an issue using the **Sprint Planning** template with a title like `SPRINT - Sprint 12`:

1. Each line under "Sprint Features (One Per Line)" becomes a child issue
2. Child issues link back with `Parent Sprint: #N`
3. Closing child issues updates burn-down; sprint auto-closes at 100%

**Required:** Install with `--with-templates` so the sprint form is available.
