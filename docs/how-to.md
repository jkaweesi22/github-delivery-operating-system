# How To Guide

Step-by-step instructions for using the Delivery Operating System after installation.

---

## Install Into Another Repo

### Step 1: Clone Delivery OS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkaweesi22/github-delivery-operating-system
cd github-delivery-operating-system
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

```bash
# Recommended: workflows + templates
./scripts/install.sh --with-templates /path/to/your-consumer-repo

# With labels (requires gh CLI, repo on GitHub)
./scripts/install.sh --with-templates --with-labels /path/to/your-consumer-repo
```

### Step 3: Create Labels

**Option A:** Actions → Setup Labels → Run workflow (no token needed)

**Option B:** If you used `--with-labels`, labels were created. Otherwise run Setup Labels from Actions.

### Step 4: Configure Variables

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `RELEASE_APPROVER` | GitHub username of release approver |
| `QA_APPROVER` | GitHub username of QA approver |
| `QA_ASSIGNEES` | Comma-separated usernames (e.g. `user1,user2`) |

### Step 5: Commit & Push

```bash
cd /path/to/your-consumer-repo
git add .github/
git commit -m "Install Delivery OS"
git push
```

## Create a Sprint

1. Issues → New issue
2. Select **SPRINT PLANNING**
3. Fill in:
   - **Sprint Name:** e.g. Sprint 12 - March 1–14
   - **Sprint dates:** Select from dropdown (preset 2-week sprints, Mar–Dec 2026)
   - **Sprint Goal:** What this sprint achieves
   - **Sprint Features (One Per Line):** One feature per line, no bullets:
     ```
     Implement burn-down chart
     Add sprint health indicator
     Prevent duplicate child creation
     ```
4. Submit

**What happens:** Child issues are created automatically. Each feature line becomes an issue with `Parent Sprint: #N`. Closing child issues updates burn-down; sprint auto-closes at 100%.

---

## Request Production Release

1. Ensure you have a sprint planning issue (e.g. #45)
2. Issues → New issue → **PRODUCTION RELEASE & QA SIGN-OFF**
3. Fill in:
   - **Sprint Reference:** #45
   - **Version / Build Number:** v2.4.1
   - **Release Summary:** What's in this release
   - **QA Summary + Evidence Links:** QA issues, screenshots, logs
   - **Overall QA Recommendation:** Approve / Reject / Conditional
4. Submit

**What happens:** Issue gets `release`, `production`, `approval` labels. Release approver is notified. For dual approval, both `RELEASE_APPROVER` and `QA_APPROVER` must comment approval.

---

## Approve a Release

**Single approval:** Release approver comments `approved`, `approve`, or `ok` on the production release issue.

**Dual approval:** Both must comment:
- Release approver: `approved`, `approve`, `ok`, or `go ahead`
- QA approver: `qa approved`, `approved`, `qa ok`, or `looks good`

Once both approve, the issue receives `ready-for-deploy`. To decline, release approver comments `declined`, `reject`, or `not approved`.

---

## Report a Bug

1. Issues → New issue → **Bug Report**
2. Fill in platform, severity, build, steps, expected/actual result
3. Submit

**What happens:** Issue gets `bug` and `qa` labels.

---

## Request QA Testing

1. Issues → New issue → **QA REQUEST**
2. Fill in related issue (#), what to test, environment, acceptance criteria
3. Submit

**What happens:** Issue gets `qa-request` label. If `QA_ASSIGNEES` is set, those users are assigned.

---

## Enable Telegram Alerts

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Get `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
3. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets
4. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`

Alerts are sent for: bugs, QA requests, sprints, production releases, PR merges to main.

---

## Uninstall

1. Delete from `.github/workflows/`:
   - `sprint-child-creator.yml`
   - `auto-close-sprint.yml`
   - `notify-release-approver.yml`
   - `authorize-deployment.yml`
   - `auto-assign-qa.yml`
   - `telegram-issues.yml`
   - `setup-labels.yml`
