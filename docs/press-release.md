# For immediate release

**GitHub Delivery Operating System launches on npm**

Structured delivery governance for GitHub is now installable with a single command.

---

**March 30, 2026**

The **GitHub Delivery Operating System** (Delivery OS) is now published on the npm registry as **`github-delivery-os`**. Engineering teams can add sprint planning, QA coordination, production release controls, and optional notifications to a repository without adopting a separate paid orchestration product.

Delivery OS copies GitHub Actions workflows and issue templates directly into the consumer repository. Automation runs locally in that repo; there is no dependency on external workflow hosts beyond GitHub.

## Summary

| **Package** | [`github-delivery-os`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-delivery-os) on npm |
| **Documentation site** | [Project homepage](https://phaneroo.github.io/github-delivery-operating-system/) |
| **Source code** | [github-delivery-operating-system](https://github.com/Phaneroo/github-delivery-operating-system) on GitHub |
| **License** | MIT |

## What the release provides

- **One-command installation** — `npx github-delivery-os install` with options for templates, labels, dry runs, and controlled overwrites when updating.
- **Consistent delivery patterns** — Sprint issues with structured feature lists, child issues, burn-down behavior, QA assignment, production release issues, and dual-approval gates (configurable via repository variables).
- **Transparency** — Workflows and templates live in `.github/` in your repository, so behavior is reviewable in version control.
- **Optional integrations** — Telegram notifications and GitHub CLI–based label setup where teams choose to enable them.

---

## Who it is for

Organizations that use **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Actions** and want **repeatable** practices for sprints, QA handoffs, and production readiness—especially when the same model should apply across **multiple repositories** without manual copy-and-paste.

---

## Install

From the root of the target repository:

```bash
npx github-delivery-os install --with-templates .
```

See [Consumer Setup](consumer-setup.md) for flags, variables, and upgrade paths.

---

## Statement

> “Shipping Delivery OS on npm lowers the barrier to adopting a clear delivery lifecycle. Teams get a documented install path, versioned releases, and the same workflows in the repo where their code already lives.”
